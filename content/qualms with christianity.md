sin can be described as disobedience to god. if heaven is without sin, how did angels have the affinity to rebel? how is it that angels could have turned away from god in heaven, but the same doesn't apply for humans? in addition, why is there a big master plan to save humans but not the fallen angels? they're just too far gone? i thought the idea of grace is that no one is ever too far gone?
___

how is it that eve was able to commit the sin of eating the fruit when sin didn’t exist until AFTER the fruit was eaten? before eating the fruit, adam and eve had no knowledge of good and evil so how could they have had an appreciation for gods goodness, or know that eating the fruit and disobeying god was a bad thing? if they WANTED to do something disobedient, wouldn’t that mean that there was already a spark of sin inside of them, even if it took a bit of deceit to make eve actually take action? if the world was truly sinless, eve wouldn’t have had that desire to "be like god" that led her to eat the fruit. and how is such curiosity a bad thing when it was god who made her with it? 
___

why are we still reading ascensions happening in the bible as if they were literal ascensions if we now know that heaven isn’t actually up? if human jesus actually rose up into space, he woulda suffocated from lack of oxygen
___

if jesus himself didn’t have a concept of "souls", it doesn't make sense that we attribute soul-related meaning to his death and resurrection
___

do we really expect that noah was skilled enough to build the ark? how did all the animals fit on the ark? what about storing all of the food required for them? and their waste? what about the animals that were carnivores? how were the behaviours of the animals controlled on the boat?
___
  
if god is omnipresent and he is EVERYWHERE, is everything not also god? or at least is god not IN everything, including unbelievers and even satan himself? any part of me that is NOT god would disprove that he is omnipresent- no?
____
  
if god is light, and light can’t exist without darkness, is god not reliant on satan for his own existence? what happens to god once satan is destroyed once and for all and darkness no longer exists? if the answer is that god defeating satan doesn’t mean that he ceases to exist, but merely that he is cast down into the lake of fire, the darkness still exists- is that not a problem? it seems weird that god would redeem everything EXCEPT one little thing. that idea sounds very manmade
___

before the fall in the garden, angels rebelled against god. satan had to exist at that point to be able to tempt adam and eve. if heaven is a reflection of the garden of eden before the fall, doesn't that imply that heaven carries the potential to become corrupt, just as the perfect garden did? 
___

we always blame adam and eve for bringing sin into the world. why do we not follow the sin back to its source? it was the snake who tempted adam and eve because the snake was already evil. how did the snake become evil? did someone else tempt it? what is the root cause of this evil? wouldn’t that be ultimately the most logical being on which to place the blame? 
___

why do christians pray that god might "keep someone on the right path"? or say that they want to "follow gods plan"? if one can go against gods plan, are they not more powerful than him? how is it that things could stray from a perfect god's plan?
___
  

christians say you need the holy spirit to "intercede for you" and allow you to understand the bible, but in most cases you can only get to the place where you have the spirit in you BY reading the bible. if you can indeed get the spirit in you by reading the bible, then does that not confirm that you DON'T need the spirit to be able to read the bible?
___
  
christians are just as prone to “sin” as anyone else, but they are “made perfect” by an external force (god) once they get to heaven so that they can no longer sin. if they can be transformed from sinful --> perfect, why can’t everybody else, too? is that not simply just a choice on god's behalf?
___

if you believe that our scientific advances allow us to calculate how far away from earth objects are in outer space, you have to also believe that the universe is billions of years old because we can see galaxies whose light would take billions of years to reach us. the only other choice would be to deny the science or believe that god created a pre-aged universe
___

it doesn't make sense that christians feel responsible to tell people that god loves them. if someone loves you it should be obvious!! it wouldn’t mean much if someone said they loved you more than anything but there was so little evidence to support their statement that someone else had to explain it to you for you to see it.
___

in the bible, you would have only seen god as a good god if you were an israelite. if you were not lucky enough to be born into this group, there is a good chance god would consider you to be an enemy and destroy you based on something outside of your control, like your ancestry or where you lived. today, however, christians say that that god is perfect but probably only because he’s on their side. that is a very privileged way of thinking that severely lacks compassion for others. if they were the party being opposed, they would prob have a very different perspective. 
___

god didn’t have make the shedding of blood a requirement for the forgiveness of sins. we act as though that is a rule he was simply bound by but he MADE that rule. If the point of that rule is that the sacrifice had to be painful for him, who was it up to decide how painful that sacrifice needed to be for it to be valid? why was it DEATH that had to be the requirement for a sin to be forgiven? why not something a little less worse (a finger prick)? or, on the other side, why not something even worse (torture and then death, or maybe 100 deaths)? we make excuses for god but refuse to accept that he was the one who designed the very frameworks he operates within, and thus he could have made those frameworks different- UNLESS we admit that there is something more powerful than god or rules that existed before him.
___

god sending a flood because people had become TOO evil implies that there is a level of evil that is acceptable. where is that line to be drawn?

why would god send a flood to kill everyone and have things be “reset”, knowing that things would inevitably decline again? also, does the fact that he chose THAT point in time to bring the flood imply that things were worse then than in the times of nero or hitler’s rule?

wouldn’t it have been a much cleaner solution to kill everyone with a disease? or better yet- do something to spark some kind of restorative transformation to spare billions of souls? this entire flow of events just doesn't make a lot of sense, and it leads one to wonder whether it wasn’t a mystical higher power who brought about the flood for very specific (and illogical) purposes, but just another natural disaster like the many we’ve seen before. (july 23, 2023)
___

people say it’s god who changes hearts while also holding to the notion that we have free will and can make the choice to accept or reject god. however, if we can’t change our own hearts then the consequences of not “choosing god” shouldn’t fall on us (july 23, 2023)

_______________

in christianity, being a good person or treating others with respect (things that we would probably all agree are virtuous) aren’t enough to get you into heaven. in fact, when it comes to gaining salvation all virtue goes out the window; the one and only thing that actually matters is obedience- ultimately obedience to god, which is seen through obedience to christian leaders who instruct you how to be obedient to their interpretation of the bible’s rules. 

but where does obedience come from? i would argue that obedience is amoral and a mere evolutionary instinct we follow in order to gain safety or belonging (for example, as infants we obey our parents because we would die without their care. as teenagers we may give into peer pressure and obey certain people around us to gain belonging in a social circle). in religious contexts, obedience to the guidelines of a religion gains us access to (and even *status* in) their community. if following this amoral instinct brings you to join a church, it's pretty likely that you'll come to believe and “gain salvation” in the eyes of a christian. yet, from a christian’s perspective, if this same thing happened in a muslim context, you would have chosen a path that instead leads to hell.

thus, this brings me to two conclusions:
1) how can we as humans be held responsible for our belief in the christian god or lack thereof if the foundation of what eventually leads to that belief (e.g. obedience) is something amoral?
2) it’s harmful to believe that obedience is virtuous simply due to the fact that it can result in a “moral” christian identity, because it is that same instinctual obedience that has lead to some of history's greatest atrocities. it's worth noting that obedience is a) the one thing commanded by fascist rulers and b) the thing that keeps capitalism running under the rule of greedy leaders.
___
potentially: instinctual desire for community + lack of information (and/or lack of critical thinking skills) = adherence to religion (july 23, 2023)

_____________

christians argue that the reason there is sin in the world is because we have free will, and that we have free will because god doesn’t want us to be “robots”. these ideas are incompatible with the notion of a perfect eternal life in heaven. if heaven is without sin, one of two things must be true:
1. we are made robots in heaven and don’t have free will anymore and thus are unable to sin
2. we are not robots in heaven and still have free will, yet that free will does not result in sin

if #1 is true and god just turns everyone in heaven into robots to prevent them from being able to choose to sin, why didn’t he just do that to everyone in the first place to avoid losing a ton of souls to hell?

if #2 is true, then it must be possible for any given one of us here on earth to use our free will to live a life without sin (unless "free will" somehow functions different on heaven vs on earth, but that seems kinda silly)

____________

if god wanted to create people for the purpose of keeping him company or even just for the sake of creating, he could have created equals that were just as powerful *and infallible* as he is. doesn’t the fact that he created beings less powerful than himself who who will suffer for eternity unless they submit to him and worship him imply that he is egotistical? a perfect god wouldn’t have needs and wouldn’t require the worship of any other being. they would be content to simply exist (july 23, 2023).
___

I don't believe we can truthfully say that we have the free will to choose to follow god. the definition of free-will is that our choices are made without the constraints of fate, so the only way we could make a free-will decision to follow god would be if we didn’t know that there was a positive/negative outcome based on our choice. in reality, instead of being presented with a choice, we find ourselves presented with a threat (july 23, 2023)
____

christians believe that we do sinful things because we are sinful beings. however, the arrival of sin in the world also supposedly brought along consequences for the earth (i.e. natural disasters) and animals (i.e. cancer) which are not caused by the immoral choices of humans. thus, nature and animals are also infected with sin- how are they going to be punished? how is it fair that humans have to suffer just because we have consciousness? (july 23, 2023)

____________

if god needed blood to be able to provide forgiveness, how is it that im able to forgive people all the time without blood? (july 24, 2023)
___

most humans agree that people should be punished when they do wrong. if someone commits a murder, they are given a prison sentence or even the death penalty as punishment for their actions. according to christians, hell is the place where sinners receive punishment for their sin. if someone really deserves hell and the most just thing would be for them to go there, is it not *immoral* to hope that they could escape such punishment? some might say, “well if they’re offered a way out by gods mercy then they should take it”, however that’s like saying it would be fine for someone innocent to take the fall for a criminal and allow the criminal to walk away unpunished- yet most people wouldn’t be ok with that. 
___
  
people say god is just, but is it not unjust for his innocent son to pay the price for humanities crimes? also, because god made a sacrifice and we haven’t paid him back, are the scales not still tipped to one side? true justice would mean the scales are balanced; humans being indebted to god is not balance and therefore that would not be a just conclusion to this whole thing. we seem to be ok with ignoring justice when it’s in the favour of humanity. 

moreover, should it not be a christian value to desire for unbelievers to go to hell because having them suffering for their sins would be the most just thing? (july 24, 2023)

____________

god changes his mind and decides not to destroy an entire people group after moses begs him not to. is this not sinful of moses? doesn’t it show that he doesn’t trust gods plan and thinks he knows better? where then, are christians meant to find the balance of asking god to intercede vs trusting that whatever happens is according to his plan? (july 24, 2023)
___

if the astrologers in the story of jesus birth were able to find him through their use of astrology, does that not prove the validity of astrology? even if it was “ultimately god leading them” there, it would have still been god working through the stars (july 25, 2023)
___

when it comes to determining whether or not someone is “saved”, it is illogical to base an eternal outcome on finite criteria. in our world, qualities such as “belief” exist on a spectrum, so it’s not as simple as either believing fully in something or not believing it it at all. how are we supposed to measure the belief of babies or cognitively disabled people? when are children able to be held accountable for their decision to follow god? if we say that it’s based on the “age of reason”, then that’s also something that exists on a spectrum- it’s not like there's one millisecond where you haven’t met the age of reason, and the next millisecond you have. so, how is it possible to determine whether someone falls into these binary categories of “saved” or “unsaved” when everything else is nature is a spectrum? (july 25, 2023)

thought exercise: let’s take the idea above and say that there WAS a way to determine the whereabouts of this lines that divides those who are in and those who are out. if we ranked each and every person who ever existed and lined them up along this line, we would come to find two individual people along the dividing line- the one who barely made it in and the one who barely didn’t. as the overall sample size increases, the differentiability of belief between these two diminishes, yet christians say that one definitely belongs in heaven and the other definitely belongs in hell and that justice is served. (july 25, 2023)
___

creation and destruction, life and death, happiness and sadness are all just two sides of the same coin; you can’t have one without the other. thus it’s illogical to believe that adam and eve eating the fruit in the garden is what made creation "fallen". we see in creation that there is a food chain that could never have worked any other way. i.e. 1) some animals can only survive by eating other animals. 2) a piece of rotting fruit creates the perfect environment for a mushroom to grow. life springs forth from death and that is a neutral thing; not a sign of creation being infected by sin. (july 30, 2023)
___

christianity is bad for mental health. two examples:
1. it forces constant self-scrutiny, making people obsess over their flaws and shortcomings. This inevitably leads to feelings of worthlessness and self-hatred because we become what we focus our attention on
2. it instills a lingering fear of not meeting the criteria for salvation, leaving believers with a persistent, underlying anxiety about eternal damnation (no matter how strong one's faith is, doubts are inescapable).

some christians might dismiss these concerns by blaming "poor theology" or shutting down the conversation with thought-terminating cliches like _“god’s ways are higher than ours - we just have to trust and obey!”_ butttt if a relationship with god is supposed to be the best thing for mental health, why don’t christian beliefs actually lead to greater mental wellness? why don’t christians do a better job of teaching people that they _aren’t_ worthless, that they _are_ inherently good? why don’t they equip people to handle uncertainty about eternal life, or teach that there’s no reason to fear hell?

i believe the answer is simply that they can’t, because doing so would contradict the very foundation of the religion. christianity’s power is dependent on self-hatred and fear- it can’t function without them. (Aug 17, 2023)

what is the end goal of christianity?
- if it's to **minimize the number of people in hell** it would make the most sense to put all of one's efforts into implementing a mass human extinction (that way, we just end things where they are now and avoid bringing any new souls into the world)
- if it's to **maximize the number of people in heaven**, christians should be the biggest environmentalists or transhumanists so that they have more time to evangelize before the human race ceases to exists.
(aug 20, 2023)

we read a definition of love in philippians and also are told in other parts of the bible that god is love. yet, how can god be kind ("love is kind") when he orders the genocide of entire people groups? how can god not envy ("love does not envy") when the bible says he is a jealous god? how can god not be self-seeking ("love is not self-seeking") when he literally created all of humanity for his own glorification? (sept 16, 2023)
___

christians like to use the verse “all scripture is god-breathed…” to support the infallibility of the bible, but forget that when that verse was written, it was not yet a part of the canon that we have today. that verse can really only be used to argue for the infallibility of the scriptures that existed prior to that point in time (sept 17, 2023)
___

christians make it seem like stories in the bible have specific meanings, however meaning is not objective; it is created when the text is interpreted by the audience. in the barbie movie for example, one person might take away that women are powerful and should be given more power, whereas another person might take away that mean are under threat because it's possible for women to seize power from men and so we need to double down and prevent that from happening. an ancient audience would have read these bible stories within a completely different cultural context than we have today and thus would have different takeaways/interpretations. however, god knew that this would happen and the bible is supposedly “living”... so are we supposed to accept that an unchanged text *can* have a changed meaning based on cultural context, or is it our responsibility to ignore our own context and completely immerse ourselves in the headspace of an ancient reader in order to grasp the meaning *they* would have most likely come to? it can’t be both because these interpretations could be contradictory (take for example any story in the bible where a woman is mistreated due to her gender). when it comes to the barbie movie, we could ask greta gerwig directly what the implied meaning of the film objectively was, however we have no objective source to go to when it comes to determining how to derive meaning from the bible (and we can’t go to the bible itself for this answer because that would be circular reasoning) (sept 21, 2023)
___

historically, the reason people ever worshipped gods (including yahweh) in the first place was because they needed things from them- their main goal was to be healthy and prosperous because they knew that it was their life on EARTH that mattered. the afterlife was a separate concern that came later (sept 23, 2023)
___

i’ve heard people say that when jesus was on the cross, he wasn’t just bearing the physical pain but also the emotional pain of having taken on the guilt of every sin ever committed. this doesn’t make sense though because in every account of the crucifixion his final words are still admirable. if he were truly feeling the guilt, hatred, rage, pain, grief, etc of having committed every heinous crime committed, surely he would have uttered different words when he was on the cross. (sept 24, 2023)
___

why would the disciples have different accounts of jesus’ last words if they were all there? some may say that the authors aren’t claiming that the last words they recorded weren’t his actual last words, but that’s how it reads and the bible is meant to be easy for all people to read so god should’ve just made it consistent (sept 24, 2023)
___
  
in genesis 3, god says “The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever". doesn't this imply that man wasn’t actually going to live forever? and therefore, that death was already man's destiny before the fruit was eaten and sin was brought into the world? (oct 3, 2023)
___

when a group is having an issue internally, it can cause dissent and weaken relationships. by pinning all of the blame for a systemic issue onto a certain person (“scapegoating”) people can put the problem behind them without actually having to get to the root of the issue. if jesus was the scapegoat for us, then his death would not have actually solved the root of the problem- we would just want to believe that it did so that we wouldn’t have to address the real issues in our society. when the problems inevitably resurface, the people are forced to find yet another scapegoat. this scapegoat needs to be someone who’s isolated/vulnerable because if someone else steps in to defend that person, the ritual is nullified. it is in this way that christians tend to take on the role of the oppressor (oct 5, 2023)
___

our “sins” are our shadows. we need to heal and integrate them, not just have them magically forgiven and taken away with a few simple words. (oct 5, 2023)
___

christianity is traumatizing because it teaches you that the desires of your authority figure (god) are more important than your own, and therefore your safety is dependent on fulfilling those needs and minimizing your own.
___

christians often interpret the first commandment (“you shall have no other gods before me”) as being symbolic and meaning that you shouldn’t “worship” things like your phone or sports or whatever but to the original audience it literally just meant that they weren’t supposed to worship the other actual gods that existed at that time. i think this is a huge deviation and i’m surprised it’s so widely accepted (oct 19, 2023)
___

christians will believe in spiritual forces but then say that the other gods in the bible weren’t actually gods?? and also the bible condemns witchcraft and mediums and all that soooo like we should be asking why that is. probably because they’re real! but why would god be threatened by those things if he’s all powerful? interestinggg (oct 19, 2023)
___

christians say our bodies are “fallen” because of death, sickness etc, yet fail to acknowledge that our bodies are also working in perfect function in the sense that they carry the intelligence to heal us and they send pain to alert us when something is wrong. they're not broken, that's just how they work. (oct 21, 2023).
___

christians today treat the reading-aloud of scripture as a sacrament because such a practice is praised in the bible, yet they only did that back in ancient times because no one was able to read loool (nov 21, 2023)

nothing that comes from within is really permitted in christianity… except faith, which is the foundation for all of it🤔 (dec 2, 2023)

yahweh hating on other religions for encouraging child sacrifice, only for yahweh to sacrifice his own child hmmm (dec 3, 2023)
___

when adam and eve ate the fruit, god didn’t say they became sinful, he said they became “like one of us, knowing good and evil”. They were changed to “know” evil (like god)- not to become evil. Thus “the fall” is really just humans starting to catch up to gods level of power - god even says “He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever” so that they don’t fully reach his level, likely because he wants to maintain his power over them. if their ability to know evil equates to them being evil, or at least having the potential for evil, then logically we have to view god in the same way (dec 6, 2023)
___

if god only cursed the ground after adam and eve ate the fruit, what was so good about eden compared to the rest of the world? wouldn't everywhere have had to be perfect before the fall? (dec 6, 2023)
___

some christians say that aborted babies or unreached people groups go to heaven because they never had the chance to develop a relationship with god. if that’s true, then shouldn't christians continue to encourage those situations so that more souls can spend eternity with god? (dec 12, 2023)
___

to defend todays canon, christians would need to stand behind the purposeful alterations made by scribes over the years. because these alterations were made by people other than the original authors it would be a bit of a stretch to hold that the alterations were ALSO “by inspiration”. if these alterations were not mystically inspired, christians would then have to believe that the experiences that the scribes had in life that led them to alter the text in those ways were all planned out by god to give us the passages we read today. that's a biggg stretch imo. and it seems to negate the idea of free will in the sense that it implies that all of these these authors were only having such experiences because god made them happen in order to create the future he had planned out the whole time. 

this whole situation is also problematic because depending on when you were alive, some people would be reading the original unaltered manuscript and others would be reading the altered one, yet they would both be considered inspired/canonical (dec 15, 2023)
___

christians tend to believe that people who deconstruct/fall away were never christians in the first place, so why does it matter to them? technically, it’s just someone going from non-christian —> non-christian. deconstruction can’t be dangerous to christianity if it doesn’t actually impact the salvation of any believers. thus, it's interesting that christians see people deconstructing as such a threat or a shock (jan 31, 2024 from a paulogia video)
___

christianity prevents people from undergoing the necessary developmental step of making your own decisions and learning from your mistakes. All of the rules are already set in place for you and you aim to act in a way that avoids making mistakes, so by the time you reach adulthood, your actions are not conscious or informed by your innermost wisdom or deepest desires or the lessons you've learned, but are a mere instinctual response to an external authority. This leaves people incapable of making decisions in situations that are more nuanced or that don’t follow the rigid guidelines that were put in place for them, and encourages other splitting behaviors. They never learned to think for themselves and will experience a lot of mental turmoil as a result. Also, because they never developed their own nuanced sense of morality, they will likely have trouble navigating morally grey areas. (april 10, 2024)
___

christians are programmed to believe that non-believers have a wall up against christianity, so when a non-believer presents a valid point to why christianity is flawed or doesn’t make sense, the christian will tend to automatically reject it without even giving it proper consideration because "the non-believer's heart is just hardened" or "they just don't understand the gospel". the christian will bypass the logic of the argument because they already have a conclusion in their mind regardless of the problem being presented and the non-believer is just being deceived into not seeing the truth. it is for this reason that i think empathy and open mindedness are some of the most important qualities one can have (and therefore also some of the qualities that christians likely lack the most) (may 20, 2024)
___

christianity invented the problematic mentality of “just as soon as [xyz], then i’ll be happy” through its stance that our lives are simply a moment of suffering before everything is one day made perfect (may 28, 2024, paraphrased from damon dominique who paraphrased from nietzche)
___
  
in christianity, the belief of god being all good and satan being all bad leads people to also label others (and themselves) as either all good or all bad. (july 17, 2024)
