10/10s! stuff that i claim. products, foods, music, whatever

#### [Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay](https://www.amazon.com/Aztec-Secret-Cleansing-Original-Bentonite/dp/B00S7ZPB8Q)

- this paired with [bragg's acv](https://www.bragg.com/products/organic-apple-cider-vinegar?variant=39529423011936)??? unmatched. really helps tighten pores and reduce inflammation. been working through a 2lb tub of this for the last 7 years bahaha. i don't have this with me while abroad though and im missing it so much

#### [Vaseline Rosy Lips](https://www.vaseline.com/us/en/p/vaseline-lip-therapy-rosy-mini.html/00305210231597)

-  i have the mini tub and the squeeze tube :) this product isn't actually tinted whatsoever but it's still sooo much better than regular vaseline-- it doesn't get all melty on your lips like regular vaseline does. its thicker and the occlusiveness just lasts longer. i've made my friends try this and they will attest to it!!

#### [Nalgene Water Bottle](https://nalgene.com/product/32oz-wide-mouth-bottle/?attribute_pa_color=red)
- seeing people walking around with dented-ass half-broken water bottles drives me up the walllll like guys we can do better!!! there are options! i know ppl love their Stanley Cups nowadays but they're sooo heavy and frankly kinda stigmatized now (for better or worse). all of my bible camp friends and i bought ours together in 2015 (shoutout [algonquin outfitters](https://algonquinoutfitters.com/), iykyk) and i would die for my baby. she's been around the world and to hell and back with me and is only getting better with age. but seriously- they're great quality (can survive the elements), don't leak, are usable while walking or driving (see [Easy Sipper](https://nalgene.com/product/wide-mouth-easy-sipper/)), and are dishwasher safe/easy enough to wash.

#### [Muji Socks](https://www.muji.us/collections/socks/products/right-angle-pile-sneaker-socks-25-29cm-dac18a3a?variant=42848104054974)
- specifically the ones linked because they're thick and cottony and last a long time and the ankle is the perfect height (anything higher unavoidably gives me hair follicle fatigue which makes me want to scream although i will say that sometimes i do put myself through that when a high sock is necessary). they discontinued the white variant of this model which is super silly and unfortunate but i imagine most of their other stuff is good too

#### Essential Oils
- HEAR ME OUT. i loove a little dab of peppermint oil on my chest or around my nose when im sick. can immediately breathe sooo much better. eucalyptus oil in the bath? hell yeah. a little drop of lavender on the wrist just for a little smell here and there? delightful

#### Cashmere Scarf
- I found a plain red cashmere scarf at a thrift store for 15 euros and it's kept me so cozy all winter. i want to be in cashmere 24/7
