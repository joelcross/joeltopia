## museums/attractions

-the louvre

-arc du triomphe

- nothing crazy special but you can see all of paris from the top and it’s pretty cool

-musee d’orsay

- iconic view from the big clock window
- has a great impressionist section with lots of famous paintings you’d recognize

-there are a tonnnn of others (note: they’re all closed on tuesdays)

-eiffel tower

- nice to even just walk around champ de mars or around the street nearby

  

## general tips

-get museum tickets ahead of time to avoid queues

-all public museums have discounts/free entry for students or people < 26, but often times you also need to be a resident. always worth checking online though

-ppl say going up the eiffel tower is overrated

-most boulangeries have sandwiches for like 5-6€

-for baguettes, the norm is to order “une baguette tradition” 

-you should always say bonjour (or bonsoir) when you walk into an establishment or start an interaction

-not missing much by avoiding the outer arrondissements. most of the action is around the centre of the city

-avoid restaurants near the big tourist attractions cuz you’ll prob get ripped off (you’ll know it’s a tourist restaurant if the menu has the french and the english on it)
