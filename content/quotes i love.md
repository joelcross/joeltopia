*Eckhart Tolle (A New Earth, page 219)*
___
> ...were the dominant [view of hell] true, all of existence would be a kind of horror story, like a tale of guests at a party at a splendid estate enjoying themselves in perfect ease of mind while far below, down in the deepest basement of the house, there lies a torture-chamber filled with victims who cannot escape and whose cries never reach the rooms overhead.

*David Bentley Hart*
___
> If you ignore your inner purpose, no matter what you do, even if it looks spiritual, the ego will creep into how you do it, and so the means will corrupt the ends... not your aims or your actions are primary, but the state of consciousness out of which they come.

*Eckhart Tolle (A New Earth, page 264)*
___
> When I like people immensely I never tell thei
> r names to anyone. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvelous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I am going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit, I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into one’s life.  

*Oscar Wilde (The Picture of Dorian Gray, page 6)*
___
> Sometimes, however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives. If these elements of beauty are real, the whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we find that we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of the play; or rather, we are both. We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthralls us.  

*Oscar Wilde (The Picture of Dorian Gray, page 105)*
___
> People need external activity because they have no internal activity... [Hence] the restlessness of those who have nothing to do, and their aimless traveling. What drives them from country to country is the same boredom which at home drives them together into such crowds and heaps it is funny to see.

___
> Shifting the story about your pain plays an important role in releasing your pain  

*Hilary McBride (A Tiny Revolution podcast)*
___
> I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.  

*Frank Herbert (Dune)*

___
> No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it.  

*Albert Einstein*
___

___
> When you cut something away there’s going to be pain before you are fully healed  

*Know Thyself podcast*
___
> Believers in religion teach us that God will reward men for good actions, but men who are intellectually free, know that the reward of a good action cannot be given by any power, but that it is the natural result of the good action. The free man, guided by intelligence, knows that his reward is in the nature of things, and not in the caprice even of the infinite. He is not a good and faithful servant, he is an intelligent free man.  

*Robert G. Ingersoll*
___
> Society becomes resentful of the ways in which victims of trauma shatter our illusions of safety. Society, therefore, is often resistant to recognizing the effects of trauma and inclined to engage in victim blaming in order to maintain basic assumptions.  

*McFarlane and Van Der Kolk*
___
> It is an absurdity to believe that the deity has human passions, and one of the lowest of human passions, a restless appetite for applause. It is an inconsistency to believe that, since the deity has this human passion, he has not others also: and, in particular, a disregard to the opinions of creatures so much inferior.  

*David Hume*
___
> Safety is not the absence of threat, it is the presence of connection  

*Gabor Mate*
___
> When the first innocence goes, you can’t stop- unless you’re a hypocrite or a fool  

*John Steinbeck (East of Eden)*
___
> Sometimes the world tests us most sharply then, and we turn inward and watch ourselves with horror. But that’s not the worst. We think everybody is seeing into us. That dirty is very dirty and purity is shining white.  

*John Steinbeck (East of Eden - Lee, page 489)*
___
> All great and precious things are lonely

*John Steinbeck (East of Eden - Lee, page 520)*
___
> If you’re trying to show off for people at the top, forget it. They will look down on you anyhow. And if you’re trying to show off for people at the bottom, forget it. They will only envy you. Status will get you nowhere.  

*Mitch Albom (Tuesday’s with Morrie)*
___
> This whole incident is a metaphor for life in general: things get broken, and sometimes they get repaired, and in most cases, you realize that no matter what gets damaged, life rearranges itself to compensate for your loss, sometimes wonderfully.  

*Hanya Yanagihara (A Little Life - Harold)*

*Wilhelm Stekel*
___
> I think… if there are as many minds as there are men, then there are as many kinds of love as there are hearts  

*Leo Tolstoy (Anna Karenina - Anna)*
___
> To say that straight men are heterosexual is only to say that they engage in sex (fucking exclusively with the other sex, i.e., women). All or almost all of that which pertains to love, most straight men reserve exclusively for other men. The people whom they admire, respect, adore, revere, honor, whom they imitate, idolize, and form profound attachments to, whom they are willing to teach and from whom they are willing to learn, and whose respect, admiration, recognition, honor, reverence and love they desire… those are, overwhelmingly, other men. In their relations with women, what passes for respect is kindness, generosity or paternalism; what passes for honor is removal to the pedestal. From women they want devotion, service and sex. Heterosexual male culture is homoerotic; it is man-loving.  

*Marilyn Frye*
___

*Ingmar Bergman*
___
> In ‘Love Must Be Tough’, [James Dobson] warned of women who ‘deliberately baited’ their husbands into hitting them, ‘verbally or physically’  

*Dr. Kristin Kobes Du Mez (Jesus and John Wayne)*
___
>Less abrasive than ‘male headship’, servant leadership framed male authority as obligation, sacrifice, and service. Men were urged to accept their responsibilities, to work hard, to serve their wives and families…Within Christian circles, the concept of servant leadership similarly enabled men to maintain their authority in the home even as they no longer maintained breadwinner status.

*Dr. Kristin Kobes Du Mez (Jesus and John Wayne)*
___
>Like military metaphors, sports called to mind a world in which men, by virtue of their superior physical strength, still dominated.

*Pat Condell*
___
>“[true love] requires an ongoing commitment to constructive struggle and change”

*Bell Hooks*
___

___
>You cannot save people, you can only love them.

*Anaïs Nin*

*Virginia Woolf*
___
>If we willing to accept unverifiable and unfalsifiable explanations for things we don’t understand, we must, to be consistent, accept fanciful explanations from anywhere about anything. This, of course, leads to accepting contradiction and absurdity.

*Genetically Modified Skeptic (YouTube)*
___
>Male fantasy is seen as something that can create reality, whereas female fantasy is regarded as pure escape

*Bell Hooks*
___
>...the will to extend one’s self for the purpose of nurturing one’s own or another’s spiritual growth

*M. Scott Peck describing love*
___
>For most folks it is just too threatening to to embrace a definition of love that would no longer enable us to see love as present in our families. Too many of us cling to a notion of love that either makes abuse acceptable or at least makes it seem that whatever happened was not that bad.

*Bell Hooks (All About Love, page 6)*
___
>It is particularly distressing that a o many recent books on love…suggest love should mean something different to men than it does to women - that the sexes should respect and adapt to our inability to communicate since we do not share the same language. This type of literature is popular because it does not demand a change in fixed ways of thinking about gender roles, culture, or love. Rather than sharing strategies that would help us become more loving it actually encourages everyone to adapt to circumstances where love is lacking.

*Bell Hooks (All About Love, page 11)*
___
>‘you can never love anybody if you are unable to love yourself’… And I add, ‘do not expect to receive the love from someone else you do not give yourself’

*Bell Hooks (All About Love, page 68)*
___
>When we can be alone, we can be with others without using them as a means of escape

*Bell Hooks (All About Love, page 140)*
___
>Premature forgiveness will prohibit us from showing the inner child that she had the right to be angry about her parent’s cold-hearted abandonment of her. It will stop us from helping her express and release those old angry feelings.

*Pete walker (Complex PTSD)*
___
>Enlightened women want fulfilling erotic encounters as much as men, but we ultimately prefer erotic satisfaction within a context where there is loving, intimate connection. If men were socialized to desire love as much as they are taught to desire sex, we would see a cultural revolution. As it stands, most men tend to be more concerned about sexual performance and sexual satisfaction than whether they are capable of giving and receiving love.

*Bell Hooks (All About Love, page 176)*
___
>The belittling of anyone’s attempt to make a context within which they were wounded, were made a victim, is a form of shaming.

*Bell Hooks (All About Love, page 232)*
___
>Reactive formation is used when repression seems to be weakening. The trait of kindness is often developed to counteract an impulse of cruelty. To be cruel would induce shame. The exact opposite of cruelty is kindness. Kindness ensures that one will not be cruel and therefore can avoid feeling shame. A reactive formation always has some of the characteristics of the very impulse whose expression it is designed to prevent…’The trait of kindness will have a rigid and inappropriate quality to it. It will be opposed on others in all circumstances whether or not it is warranted. It will have a coercive and thinly sadistic quality. The person who exhibits such reactive kindness is a person who kills with kindness.’

*John Bradshaw (Healing the Shame that Binds You - Chapter 4, Secondary Ego Defenses)*
___
>Someone who was not allowed to be aware of what was being done has no way of telling about it, except to repeat it.”

*William Blake*
___
>suppression of expression leads to depression

*TikTok (lol)*
___
>Examination of the world without is never as personally painful as examination of the world within, and it is certainly because of the pain involved in a life of genuine self-examination that the majority steer away from it. Yet when one is dedicated to the truth this pain seems relatively unimportant— and less and less important (and therefore less painful) the farther one proceeds on the path of self-examination

*M. Scott Peck (The Road Less Traveled, page 52)*
___
>Indeed, all self-discipline might be defined as teaching ourselves to do the unnatural. Another characteristic of human nature — perhaps the one that makes us most human — is our capacity to do the unnatural, to transcend and hence transform our own nature

*M. Scott Peck (The Road Less Traveled, page 53)*
___
>He had to learn that not giving at the right time was more compassionate than giving at the wrong time, and that fostering independence was more living than taking care of people who could otherwise take care of themselves. He even had to learn that expressing his own needs, anger, resentments and expectations was every bit as necessary to the mental health of his family as his self-sacrifice, and therefore that love must be manifested in confrontation as much as in beatific acceptance.

*M. Scott Peck (The Road Less Traveled, page 113)*
